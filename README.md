# SurfelMapping
Real time traffic scene mapping using dense surfel representation.

This repo is part of the code of our LADS: Lightweight Autonomous Driving Simulator Using Surfel Mapping and GAN Enhancement. The SurfelMapping rebuilds the 3D traffic scene from images collected by stereo camera of a driving vihecle. The 3D model is represented by surfels to make the rendered images more realistic.

The code is inspired by https://www.imperial.ac.uk/dyson-robotics-lab/downloads/elastic-fusion/
